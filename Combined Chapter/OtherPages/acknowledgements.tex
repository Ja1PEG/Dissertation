\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
This dissertation was a journey, filled to the brim with countless late nights, and error filled programs but as I come to the end of this journey, I would be amiss if I did not extend my gratitude to the support and guidance to firstly, my parents, for encouragement and support throughout this academic endeavour. To Dr. Sumithra Surendralal, I offer my deepest appreciation for her guidance, mentorship and unwavering support, one could say it served as a \textit{ladder} taking me through this research project. I am also grateful to my friends for their support, willingness to engage with my explorations, and hyping me up by telling me how interesting this topic is to them. A special acknowledgement is due to Simba, my cat, for his \textit{consistent} involvement in the writing process, although it wasn't always conducive to productivity. Lastly, I would like to particularly thank Sheuli, for her invaluable role as a sounding board, and for always supporting me throughout this process. This dissertation is a testament to the collective support I have received, and I am deeply appreciative of each contribution.
