\chapter{Conclusion}
This research project embarked on a systematic exploration of Snakes and Ladders dynamics, driven by the ambition to look beyond the subjective interpretations of game enjoyment and establish a more quantifiable understanding of mechanical enjoyability.  By embracing a mixed-methods paradigm, combining agent-based simulations and Markov Chain modelling, this dissertation has rigorously investigated the impact of diverse game parameters and design elements on the emergent game dynamics and multifaceted player experience. The findings from this project collectively illuminate the intricate, and at times counter-intuitive, interplay between core game mechanics, strategic board design, and inherent probabilistic outcomes, not only within the specific context of Snakes and Ladders but also offering broader insights applicable to the wider realm of tabletop games.

Delving into the empirical domain, Chapter 2’s extensive agent-based simulations meticulously dissected the nuanced effects of systematically varying the number and lengths of snakes and ladders.  This chapter unveiled a critical insight: while mere increases in the \textit{quantity} ($N_s$ or $N_l$) of snakes and ladders did not linearly correlate with game duration, \textit{extreme disparities} in their counts significantly amplified game duration variability.  Specifically, configurations with a disproportionately high number of snakes coupled with fewer ladders were demonstrably prone to producing outlier game sessions of extended length, indicative of heightened ‘luck dependency’ and potential player frustration. Conversely, augmenting $N_l$ was shown to exert a stabilising influence, tending to curtail game times and diminish variability, thus promoting a more consistent and predictable player experience.  Furthermore, our investigation into entity lengths revealed that the relationship between $L_s$ and $L_l$, rather than absolute lengths themselves, constituted a more potent determinant of game dynamics. Wider disparities, particularly scenarios where snakes were designed to be markedly longer than ladders, consistently translated to shorter game durations, shedding light on the intuitive impact of setbacks outweighing the short-cuts on perceived game ``hardness".

Building upon this empirical foundation, Chapter 3 broadened the scope to examine the impact of scaling the game board, maintaining consistent entity density. Counter-intuitively, and perhaps most strikingly, this phase of the research revealed that while larger boards predictably and unequivocally \textit{increase} average game time – a finding consistent with intuitive expectations of increased traversal distance – they simultaneously, and paradoxically, \textit{enhance} the probability of achieving swift victories within defined turn limits.  This effect was attributed to the proportionally greater number of pathways and expanded tile options inherent in larger board configurations.  Increased board size, in essence, provides players with a more ``diffused" game space, offering a statistically higher likelihood of circumventing clusters of snakes and capitalising on strategically advantageous ladder placements, even within the context of overall prolonged game sessions.  Across both parameter variation and board scaling experiments, the ratio of snakes to ladders ($N_s/N_l$) consistently emerged as a dominant and readily tunable factor, demonstrably influencing both mean game duration and the probability of achieving a quick win, thereby solidifying its crucial role as a primary modulator of overall game difficulty and player-perceived pacing.

Chapter 4 transitioned from empirical simulation to the development of a Markov Chain model explicitly tailored to the mechanics of Snakes and Ladders.  This model, constructed to capture the probabilistic transitions inherent in dice rolls and entity interactions, proved remarkably effective in analytically predicting core game metrics.  Comparative analyses, juxtaposing model-derived predictions against empirically observed data from agent-based simulations, demonstrated a compelling similarity across expected game turns, win probabilities within turn limits, and entire game turn distributions.  Beyond just the predictive accuracy, the Markov model distinguished itself through its analytical efficiency, offering a direct and deterministic computational pathway to derive these crucial game metrics – a stark contrast to the computationally intensive and inherently stochastic nature of repeated agent-based simulations. Furthermore, analysis of the steady-state distribution, derived directly from the Markov model, yielded a unique perspective, revealing long-term probabilities of tile occupation and effectively mapping ‘gameplay hotspots’ for all kinds of board layouts and equilibrium states inherent within the Snakes and Ladders game space.

The concept of an “optimal” Snakes and Ladders board layout, as illuminated by this research, transcends simplistic notions of minimising average game time.  Rather, optimality should be conceived as a carefully calibrated \textit{balance} across multiple, sometimes competing, design objectives – a strategic orchestration of game parameters to achieve a nuanced and pre-defined target level of mechanical enjoyability.  The $N_s/N_l$ ratio, in particular, stands out as a readily accessible and potent design lever for effectively balancing challenge and pacing, while board size emerges as a more complex control, impacting not only overall game length but also subtly modulating the statistical likelihood of swift, yet potentially less consistently achievable, victories.  The Markov Chain model, furthermore, provides game designers with a valuable and analytically efficient tool, enabling rapid prediction of key game metrics for any given board configuration and fostering a more data-driven and iterative approach to game balancing, playtesting, and refinement. This dissertation, by providing an objective and quantifiable framework, offering tools for making such crucial design choices more explicitly understood, analytically informed, and demonstrably optimisable, potentially paving the way for the design of more engaging, balanced, and commercially successful tabletop game iterations.

However, it is crucial to acknowledge inherent limitations within the scope and methodology of this research.  Firstly, the very stochasticity that defines Snakes and Ladders, while effectively captured through probabilistic modelling, also introduces an irreducible element of randomness that inherently bounds the predictability of any single game instance.  While the Markov model and simulation analyses provide robust estimates of \textit{average} game behaviour across numerous iterations, individual game sessions will inevitably exhibit variance due to the inherent dice roll probabilities, a factor that contributes to experiential enjoyability but simultaneously limits deterministic predictability at the micro-level.  Secondly, the exploration of board layout design space, while systematic in its parameter variations and board scaling experiments, necessarily remained constrained to a relatively limited subset of all conceivable board configurations.  The research primarily focused on manipulating entity counts, lengths, and overall board size, but did not exhaustively explore the potentially significant impact of \textit{specific placements} of snakes and ladders, or the nuanced effects of varying board topology beyond simple square grids.  Further research could benefit from investigating a wider and more diverse range of board layout patterns and algorithmic approaches to board generation to more comprehensively map the design space of optimal Snakes and Ladders configurations.  Finally, this dissertation’s primary focus on mechanical enjoyability, while providing valuable insights into quantifiable game dynamics, inherently represents a partial perspective on the holistic player experience.  Future research should explicitly bridge the gap between these quantifiable metrics of mechanical enjoyability and the more subjective, qualitative domain of experiential enjoyability.  Player testing, user studies employing diverse board layouts and game configurations, and integrating qualitative feedback alongside quantitative metrics will be essential for validating the perceptual impact of mechanically ‘optimal’ designs and for achieving a more complete understanding of overall game enjoyment.

In conclusion, this dissertation has rigorously demonstrated the value of a systematic, mixed-methods, and quantifiable approach to understanding the complex dynamics underpinning seemingly simple games like Snakes and Ladders. By effectively combining empirical simulation with the analytical power of Markov Chain modelling, the research not only provides practical and actionable insights for game designers seeking to create more engaging and balanced tabletop experiences but also contributes a robust methodological framework and a more objective, data-driven foundation for future research within the ever-evolving field of game studies, bridging the gap between game mechanics and player enjoyment within tabletop games.
