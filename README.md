# Snakes and Ladders Simulation Project
## Description
A Python-based statistical analysis of Snakes and Ladders game mechanics using different probability distributions.

## Project Overview
This project simulates and analyzes the Snakes and Ladders game with:

* Multiple board configurations
* Different probability distributions for snake/ladder lengths
* Statistical analysis of game completion times
