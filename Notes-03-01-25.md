- Placement of the Snakes and Ladders to be addressed more carefully

  - Distinction between Snake/Ladder Start and End insead of base/top and Mouth/Tail
  - Be More specific about the Overlap Constraints (In Between Placement needs to be addressed)
  - Validation cases used in the program needed to be mentioned explicitly in this case

- Merge 2.2 and 2.3
- Fix the confusion in Boundaries caused by Snake/Ladder Start/End Base/Top Mouth/Tail
- Fix the "Increasing Positively" - Figure that shows - Mention the Margin of Error (Define significance of Margin of Error)
- Define Stability - More Layouts (Times Involved)
- Show One Plot Extended - More Board Layouts for any one kind of Sampling Distribution
- Show One Plot Extended - More Board Layouts for the final Approach (Random Start and End)
- Distribution of Lengths of Snakes and Ladders in the 3rd Approach in each board
- Overlay all three distributions on the same plot - Sampling One
- Define Optimal
- Try to find zones where Snakes and Ladders being placed could showcase a stronger effect on game time
- Maybe Markov Process to make conclusions
- Introductory Chapter (Snakes and Ladders Literature, why is this relevant in terms of enjoyability, Playing a Satisfying game, what does that mean)

# 17th Jan Next Meeting

- Comparison of game times across various sampling distributions, reason the logic behind this.

  - Is the placement somehow important and also the choice of the ways to setup the board, which one to take forward for the final study.
  - Distribution of avg game times for many board layouts, with the last category.
    - If it comes out stable, we proceed with this.

- Parameterising other components of the model.
- Read Around the World in 80 Games Markov Modelling for Snakes and Ladders
- Hotspots on the board need to be identified
- Comment - Define the phrases "Subjective" and "Mechanical" enjoyability
- Send work to Sitabhra, Tell him the expected timeline, Defense after the submission
  - CV

Every week once we Meet - Wednesday (10AM) to meet otherwise Ma'am will inform.

# Meeting 19/01

- Transition Matrix - Markov Chain
  - Compare it to the simulation data
  - Expected number of terms - Sautoy
  - Find the Steady State Distribution - Markov Chain
- Average Number of turns against

## Chapter Layout

- Introductory
- Chapter 1 +2
- Markov Modelling
- From there, think about optimal board layout (Against real board)
- Conclusion

# Meeting 26/02

## Introductory Chapter

- Marcus Du Sutoy Chapter 1 Needs to be checked out, has some vagueness - Needs to be reworked
  - Feels like Im looking at all of Sutoy's works

## Preliminary Computations - Draft 1 and 2 combined

- Change the captions to include the learnings (Chapter 1 and 2 Draft combined)
  - Add descriptive captions - Analytical - Done
- Redo the font sizing of the plots
- Notion of Mechanical Compatibilty - Done

## General Feedback

- Board Layouts all on a heatmap - Done

## Markov Feedback

- Take out a 4 state model (4x4 transition matrix) and do the calculations by hand just to understand

  - Write both Q and R - Done
  - Then Compute N - Done
  - Why does the entry n(ij) represent what its supposed to
  - Write down the math and show it to ma'am as a proof of concept

- Compare the two distributions - Play it using Markov Transition Matrix and General Simulations - Analytical Solution
  - I have a layout, and that layout can simulate a game, I can create a distribution of winning times using this one board layout
  - Based on this board layout I build a markov model. Does a markov model capture game dynamics well or not
  - Use the transition probabilities to also simulate games, create the same distribution and see how they compare
  - Markov model gives a way to analytically reach the game time
- Send this out to Sitabhra by EoD and then discuss based on that

# Meeting 10/03

- Chapter 4 (Maybe 3):
  - Keep the density of Snakes/Ladders (Maybe the lengths also) consistent across varying sizes of the board (Show both extremes)
    - Does it begin to break down/Crash Out
    - Connect this idea to hardness/time taken to play a particular game being inconvenient
  - Trajectory of games being played out
  - Probability of game ending in n many steps (Based on the board size)
    - Figure out the distribution it may use
    - Decide probability of game ending in n many steps (n/2, n/4 steps)
    
- Fix the interpretations - Be Explicit about why certain things are being checked/used why analysis of certain things has been conducted, etc. 
- At various points, include the plots necessary 
- Writing about the 1 Dimensional Board
(Directed Percolation Problem)
