- Placement of the Snakes and Ladders to be addressed more carefully

  - Distinction between Snake/Ladder Start and End insead of base/top and Mouth/Tail
  - Be More specific about the Overlap Constraints (In Between Placement needs to be addressed)
  - Validation cases used in the program needed to be mentioned explicitly in this case

- Merge 2.2 and 2.3
- Fix the confusion in Boundaries caused by Snake/Ladder Start/End Base/Top Mouth/Tail
- Fix the "Increasing Positively" - Figure that shows - Mention the Margin of Error (Define significance of Margin of Error)
- Define Stability - More Layouts (Times Involved)
- Show One Plot Extended - More Board Layouts for any one kind of Sampling Distribution
- Show One Plot Extended - More Board Layouts for the final Approach (Random Start and End)
- Distribution of Lengths of Snakes and Ladders in the 3rd Approach in each board
- Overlay all three distributions on the same plot - Sampling One
- Define Optimal
- Try to find zones where Snakes and Ladders being placed could showcase a stronger effect on game time
- Maybe Markov Process to make conclusions
- Introductory Chapter (Snakes and Ladders Literature, why is this relevant in terms of enjoyability, Playing a Satisfying game, what does that mean)

# 17th Jan Next Meeting

- Comparison of game times across various sampling distributions, reason the logic behind this.

  - Is the placement somehow important and also the choice of the ways to setup the board, which one to take forward for the final study.
  - Distribution of avg game times for many board layouts, with the last category.
    - If it comes out stable, we proceed with this.

- Parameterising other components of the model.
- Read Around the World in 80 Games Markov Modelling for Snakes and Ladders
- Hotspots on the board need to be identified
- Comment - Define the phrases "Subjective" and "Mechanical" enjoyability
- Send work to Sitabhra, Tell him the expected timeline, Defense after the submission
  - CV

Every week once we Meet - Wednesday (10AM) to meet otherwise Ma'am will inform.

# Meeting 19/01

- Transition Matrix - Markov Chain
  - Compare it to the simulation data
  - Expected number of terms - Sautoy
  - Find the Steady State Distribution - Markov Chain
- Average Number of turns against

## Chapter Layout

- Introductory
- Chapter 1 +2
- Markov Modelling
- From there, think about optimal board layout (Against real board)
- Conclusion
