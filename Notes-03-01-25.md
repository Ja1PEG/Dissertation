- Placement of the Snakes and Ladders to be addressed more carefully
	- Distinction between Snake/Ladder Start and End insead of base/top and Mouth/Tail
	- Be More specific about the Overlap Constraints (In Between Placement needs to be addressed)
	- Validation cases used in the program needed to be mentioned explicitly in this case

- Merge 2.2 and 2.3
- Fix the confusion in Boundaries caused by Snake/Ladder Start/End Base/Top Mouth/Tail
- Fix the "Increasing Positively" - Figure that shows - Mention the Margin of Error (Define significance of Margin of Error)
- Define Stability - More Layouts (Times Involved)
- Show One Plot Extended - More Board Layouts for any one kind of Sampling Distribution
- Show One Plot Extended - More Board Layouts for the final Approach (Random Start and End) 
- Distribution of Lengths of Snakes and Ladders in the 3rd Approach in each board
- Overlay all three distributions on the same plot - Sampling One
- Define Optimal
- Try to find zones where Snakes and Ladders being placed could showcase a stronger effect on game time
- Maybe Markov Process to make conclusions
- Introductory Chapter (Snakes and LAdders Literature, why is this relevant in terms of enjoyability, Playing a Satisfying game, what does that mean)

- 17th Jan Next Meeting
