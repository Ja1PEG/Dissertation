# Meeting 26/02

## Introductory Chapter

- Marcus Du Sutoy Chapter 1 Needs to be checked out, has some vagueness - Needs to be reworked
  - Feels like Im looking at all of Sutoy's works

## Preliminary Computations - Draft 1 and 2 combined

- Change the captions to include the learnings (Chapter 1 and 2 Draft combined)
  - Add descriptive captions - Analytical - Done
- Redo the font sizing of the plots
- Notion of Mechanical Compatibilty - Done

## General Feedback

## Markov Feedback

- Take out a 4 state model (4x4 transition matrix) and do the calculations by hand just to understand

  - Write both Q and R - Done
  - Then Compute N - Done
  - Why does the entry n(ij) represent what its supposed to
  - Write down the math and show it to ma'am as a proof of concept

- Compare the two distributions - Play it using Markov Transition Matrix and General Simulations - Analytical Solution
  - I have a layout, and that layout can simulate a game, I can create a distribution of winning times using this one board layout
  - Based on this board layout I build a markov model. Does a markov model capture game dynamics well or not
  - Use the transition probabilities to also simulate games, create the same distribution and see how they compare
  - Markov model gives a way to analytically reach the game time
- Send this out to Sitabhra by EoD and then discuss based on that

Ns/Nl Ratio Directly Impacts Game Hardness:

Claim: "Simulations demonstrate a clear and consistent trend: increasing the Ns/Nl ratio (the ratio of snake count to ladder count) generally leads to an increase in average game time and a decrease in win probabilities (Figures X and Y - Trend Plots of Avg. Turns and Win Probabilities vs. Ns/Nl Ratio). This confirms that the Ns/Nl ratio is a primary determinant of game hardness in Snakes and Ladders."

Interpretation: "A higher Ns/Nl ratio implies a greater density of snakes relative to ladders, naturally introducing more obstacles and setbacks into the game, prolonging game duration and making quick wins less probable. This finding aligns with intuitive expectations and provides quantitative evidence for the impact of entity ratios on game difficulty."

Non-Linear Scaling with Ns/Nl Ratio:

Claim: "The relationship between Ns/Nl ratio and average game time is not strictly linear. The increase in average turns with increasing Ns/Nl ratio appears to be non-linear, with the rate of increase often accelerating at higher ratios (Figure X)."

Interpretation: "This non-linearity suggests that the impact of adding snakes becomes more pronounced as the board becomes more 'snake-heavy' relative to ladders. Beyond a certain threshold, each additional snake might have a disproportionately larger effect on extending game time."

Board Size Amplifies Ns/Nl Ratio Effects (Potentially):

Observation (Tentative): "Visually, the trend plots suggest that the slope of the average turns vs. Ns/Nl ratio curves might be steeper for larger board sizes (Figure X), particularly for the 'Fixed Ladder Density' simulations."

Interpretation (Hypothesis): "This observation, if statistically confirmed, could indicate an interaction effect between board size and Ns/Nl ratio. Larger boards might amplify the impact of entity ratios, making the game more sensitive to changes in the balance between snakes and ladders at higher board dimensions. Further statistical analysis (e.g., examining slopes or interaction terms in a regression model) could be used to investigate this potential interaction effect more rigorously."

Density Type (Fixed Snakes vs. Fixed Ladders) - Subtle Differences:

Observation: "Comparisons between 'Fixed Snake Density' and 'Fixed Ladder Density' simulations reveal subtle differences. For comparable Ns/Nl ratios and board sizes, 'Fixed Ladder Density' configurations tend to exhibit slightly [higher/lower] average game times and [higher/lower] win probabilities than 'Fixed Snake Density' configurations (Table Y, Figures X and Y)."

Interpretation (Possible Hypothesis): "This suggests that fixing ladder density and varying snake count (to change ratio) might have a slightly different impact on game dynamics compared to fixing snake density and varying ladder count. Perhaps the density of ladders, which facilitate upward progression, has a more critical influence on overall game pace and win probability than the density of snakes, which primarily introduce setbacks."

Relate to Game Hardness and Design Choices:

Claim: "By manipulating the Ns/Nl ratio and board size, game designers can effectively modulate the mechanical hardness of Snakes and Ladders, as reflected in average game time and win probabilities. A lower Ns/Nl ratio and smaller board sizes result in shorter, potentially 'easier' games, while higher ratios and larger boards lead to longer, more challenging experiences."

Design Recommendation: "Designers can strategically adjust the Ns/Nl ratio to target specific average game durations or win probability ranges, depending on the desired level of challenge and player engagement. For example, for a quick, casual game experience, a lower Ns/Nl ratio (favoring ladders) and smaller board sizes might be optimal. For a more strategic or challenging game, a higher Ns/Nl ratio and larger boards could be employed."Ns/Nl Ratio Directly Impacts Game Hardness:
